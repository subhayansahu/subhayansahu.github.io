I am Subhayan Sahu, a fifth year PhD student in theoretical physics at the [Condensed Matter Theory Center](https://www.physics.umd.edu/cmtc/) in University of Maryland, College Park. My thesis advisor is Prof. [Brian Swingle](https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/adjunct-faculty/item/876-bswingle.html).

My work involves developing analytical and numerical tools to study quantum information dynamics and thermalization in systems relevant to condensed matter and quantum simulation. I am also interested in developing novel numerical techniques for studying problems in condensed matter physics from a tensor network perspective.
