I am Subhayan Sahu, a postdoctoral researcher studying quantum matter and quantum information at the [Perimeter Institute of Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/). I got my PhD in theoretical physics in 2022 at the [Condensed Matter Theory Center](https://www.physics.umd.edu/cmtc/) in University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof. [Brian Swingle](https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/adjunct-faculty/item/876-bswingle.html).

I primarily study quantum information dynamics and thermalization in systems relevant to condensed matter and quantum simulation. During my PhD I have studied universal properties of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems, and measurement and disorder induced non-equilibrium quantum phases, using analytically tractable models and tensor-network inspired numerical methods. Please check out my [Research](https://subhayansahu.github.io/research/) page for more details about my publications.
